            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a data scientist and neuroscientist with a Ph.D. in Neurobiology from Yale University and a background in Cognitive Science and Applied Mathematics. 
                I have experience building custom data pipelines and ML systems from scratch to production, 
                and am currently exploring mobile app development to help people improve their well-being.
                I've become much more interested in work that requires having good taste (UX) and empathy since these seem more AI-safe, 
                at least for the moment. Outside of work, I enjoy running, skiing, pickleball, poker, and spending time with my family. </p>
